            <h3>remembering Steve Jobs</h3>
            <p>Not sure I have ever felt this deep of a sadness for an individual I had never met. I can only surmise that it stems from what I became (an Art Director) due in part to my trusted Macs through the years. From the first Mac in our house in
                1984 to this day I have never worked on anything but an Apple computer. My deepest condolences to his family and the Apple community.
